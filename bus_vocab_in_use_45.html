                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">A: Cultures and Culture</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Culture</strong> is essentially "the way we do things here." This simple phrase covers the shared values, beliefs, and practices of a group, which could be a whole country, a social class, or a specific organization. Understanding these different layers of culture is key to successful business communication.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-outside space-y-4 text-gray-700 ml-5">
                            <li><strong>Company or corporate culture:</strong> This is the unique personality of a company. It includes the official mission and values, but also the unwritten rules about how people behave, communicate, and make decisions. For example, a tech startup might have a casual, innovative culture that encourages risk-taking, while a bank will likely have a more formal, conservative culture focused on security and procedure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Canteen culture:</strong> This refers to the informal, unofficial culture created by employees themselves. It's the gossip, jokes, and opinions shared "unofficially" in the canteen, by the coffee machine, or in team chats. This can sometimes be negative, spreading rumors or resisting management's plans, but it can also be a source of camaraderie and support.</li>
                            <li><strong>Long-hours culture:</strong> In this environment, it's expected and often implicitly demanded that employees work more than their contracted hours. Staying late is seen as a sign of commitment and ambition. This is common in fields like law and investment banking, but it can lead to burnout and lower overall productivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Macho culture:</strong> This describes a workplace dominated by traditionally masculine traits like aggression, competitiveness, and a "work hard, play hard" attitude. Decision-making might be confrontational, and there's often little tolerance for perceived weakness. This can create a hostile environment for those who don't fit the mould and can stifle collaboration and creativity.</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-gray-600 italic bg-sky-100 p-3 rounded-lg">A crucial point is to be careful of <strong>stereotypes</strong>. These are oversimplified and often inaccurate beliefs about a group of people (e.g., "All accountants are boring," or "All salespeople are aggressive"). Relying on stereotypes in business can lead to serious misjudgements, offend partners, and cause you to miss valuable opportunities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="vocab-card">
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">B: Distance and Familiarity</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">The relationship between managers and employees varies significantly across cultures. This concept, often called 'power distance', influences communication, decision-making, and daily interactions.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-outside space-y-4 text-gray-700 ml-5">
                            <li>A company is <strong>hierarchical</strong> if it has many management <strong>layers</strong>. In such organizations, managers are often <strong>distant</strong> and <strong>remote</strong>, meaning they don't mix socially or professionally with their subordinates.</li>
                            <li>In these hierarchical cultures, employees typically show a lot of <strong>deference</strong> to their bosses. This means they respect their authority, accept decisions without question, and don't usually participate in the decision-making process.</li>
                            <li>Conversely, in 'flat' organizations with fewer management layers, managers are more likely to be <strong>accessible</strong> and <strong>approachable</strong>. They are seen as part of a team of equals, and employees are often involved in decisions.</li>
                            <li>Language is a key indicator of this distance. Some languages have different <strong>forms of address</strong> (like the formal and informal 'you') to show respect and familiarity. While English only has one form, 'you', the same effect is achieved by choosing between first names and surnames. Using "Call me Stefan" suggests an informal, approachable culture, whereas "Call me Mr. Johnson" indicates a more formal, hierarchical one.</li>
